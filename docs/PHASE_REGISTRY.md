## Current Direction

RedThread is now in the **Phase 7 autoresearch era**:
- `phase5` is the bounded offense lane
- `phase6` is the bounded defense-prompt lane
- both lanes still require the existing Phase 3 accept/reject boundary and explicit promotion discipline

This means the project direction after GS-MCTS is no longer “add more jailbreak algorithms first.” The current direction is **safe self-improvement with bounded mutation surfaces**.

## Next Bounded Steps

The next finite milestones after 7A and 7B are:
1. deepen Phase 6 from prompt-contract checks into richer sealed replay fixtures
2. add defense-specific promotion and revalidation reporting before production promotion
3. keep offense mutation surfaces stable while hardening end-to-end defense utility guarantees
4. only after that, consider widening the mutable defense surface beyond prompt/template assets

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Foundation & PAIR
**Objective**: Establish the core engine with the simplest attack algorithm.

**Deliverables**:
- `src/redthread/core/pair.py` — PAIR iterative refinement loop
- `src/redthread/evaluation/judge.py` — JudgeAgent with Auto-CoT (G-Eval)
- `src/redthread/models.py` — Core data models (Persona, AttackTrace, JudgeVerdict)
- `src/redthread/cli.py` — Rich CLI with Click
- `src/redthread/evaluation/rubrics/authorization_bypass.yaml` — First rubric
- `tests/test_pair.py`, `tests/test_judge.py`, `tests/test_tasks.py`

**Key Decisions**:
- Python 3.12+ with Pydantic v2 for type safety
- PyRIT as infrastructure plumbing (Adapter pattern)
- GPT-4o as the sole Judge model

---

### Phase 2: PAIR Refinement
**Objective**: Harden the PAIR loop and add persona-based attack diversity.

**Deliverables**:
- `src/redthread/personas/generator.py` — MITRE ATLAS-based persona generation
- `src/redthread/personas/atlas_taxonomy.py` — Tactic/technique definitions
- Enhanced `pair.py` with attacker CoT parsing
- `src/redthread/pyrit_adapters/targets.py` — RedThreadTarget wrapper

**Key Decisions**:
- Asymmetric model deployment: Attacker (lightweight) + Judge (heavyweight)
- PyRIT `send_prompt_async` as the sole interaction interface

---

### Phase 3: TAP Algorithm
**Objective**: Implement Tree of Attacks with Pruning for deep vulnerability discovery.

**Deliverables**:
- `src/redthread/core/tap.py` — 4-phase TAP: Branch → Pre-Query Prune → Attack+Assess → Post-Score Prune
- `src/redthread/models.py` — Added `AttackNode` model (tree node with `parent_id`, `depth`, `score`)
- `src/redthread/cli.py` — Added `--algorithm` flag
- `tests/test_tap.py`

**Key Decisions**:
- TAP reuses PAIR's prompt templates for consistency
- Aggressive pruning (`tree_width=10`) to prevent exponential tree explosion
- Gap analysis documented in `docs/GAP_ANALYSIS_PHASE3.md`

---

### Phase 4: LangGraph Orchestration
**Objective**: Multi-agent coordination via supervisor-worker architecture.

**Deliverables**:
- `src/redthread/orchestration/supervisor.py` — LangGraph StateGraph with 6 nodes
- `src/redthread/orchestration/graphs/attack_graph.py` — Attack worker subgraph
- `src/redthread/orchestration/graphs/judge_graph.py` — Judge worker subgraph
- `src/redthread/orchestration/graphs/defense_graph.py` — Defense worker subgraph
- `src/redthread/engine.py` — Refactored to facade over SupervisorGraph
- `tests/test_supervisor.py`

**Key Decisions**:
- LangGraph `Send` API for parallel attack fan-out
- Conditional routing: defense synthesis only triggers on confirmed jailbreaks
- Plain dict state (serializable) for LangGraph compatibility

---

### Phase 4.5: Defense Synthesis & Telemetry
**Objective**: Close the attack loop with automated guardrail generation and drift detection.

**Deliverables**:
- `src/redthread/core/defense_synthesis.py` — 5-step synthesis pipeline (Isolate → Classify → Generate → Validate → Deploy)
- `src/redthread/core/guardrail_loader.py` — Runtime guardrail injection scoped by `target_model + prompt_hash`
- `src/redthread/telemetry/embeddings.py` — Async embedding clients (Ollama/OpenAI)
- `src/redthread/telemetry/drift.py` — K Core-Distance drift detection
- `src/redthread/memory/index.py` — MEMORY.md persistence
- `src/redthread/memory/consolidation.py` — Dream-like knowledge consolidation
- `tests/test_defense.py`, `tests/test_guardrail_loader.py`, `tests/test_telemetry.py`
- `docs/DEFENSE_PIPELINE.md`

**Key Decisions**:
- Defense Architect initially reused Attacker model (flagged as risk in Phase 5A)
- GuardrailLoader uses SHA-256 hash-based scoping for target isolation
- Dependency-light telemetry (numpy + httpx, no PyTorch)

---

### Phase 5A: Anti-Hallucination Baseline ✅
**Objective**: Establish the evaluation baseline. Fix P0 blockers before drift monitoring.

**Status**: Completed 2026-04-03
- **Faithfulness**: 1.00 (Target: ≥ 0.92)
- **Hallucination Rate**: 0.00 (Target: ≤ 0.08)
- **Jailbreak Precision**: 1.00 (Target: ≥ 0.90)
- **Safe Recall**: 1.00 (Target: ≥ 0.90)

**Prerequisites Completed**:
- **P0.1**: Defense Architect model decoupled from Attacker (new `defense_architect_model` in settings, default GPT-4o, temperature=0.1)
- **P0.2**: Golden Dataset created (30 curated traces: 10 jailbreak, 10 safe, 10 guardrail)
- **P0.3**: DeepEval-style evaluation pipeline (`evaluation/pipeline.py`)
- **P1.1**: Per-role temperature enforcement (`attacker_temperature`, `judge_temperature`, `defense_architect_temperature`)

**New Files**:
- `src/redthread/evaluation/pipeline.py` — CI/CD evaluation pipeline
- `tests/golden_dataset/golden_traces.py` — 30 curated test cases
- `tests/test_golden_dataset.py` — Regression test suite
- `docs/ANTI_HALLUCINATION_SOP.md` — General anti-hallucination engineering standard
- `docs/PHASE_REGISTRY.md` — This document

**Key Decisions**:
- **Evaluation Framework**: DeepEval (Pytest-native) exclusively. RAGAS deferred to avoid bloat.
- **Defense Architect Model**: Configurable, default GPT-4o with temperature=0.1. Decoupled from Attacker.
- **Observability**: LangSmith (first-party LangGraph support). Deferred to Phase 5D.
- **Golden Dataset**: Hybrid (synthetic bootstrap + manual curation).
- **Scope**: Phase 5A only. Phases 5B-5D deferred until baseline is mathematically proven stable.

**CI/CD Thresholds**:
| Metric | Threshold |
|---|---|
| Faithfulness | ≥ 0.92 |
| Hallucination Rate | ≤ 0.08 |
| Jailbreak Precision | ≥ 0.90 |
| Safe Recall | ≥ 0.90 |

---

### Phase 5B: ARIMA & ASI *(In Progress → Complete)*
**Objective**: Detect agent degradation statistically before full jailbreaks occur.

**Prerequisites Completed**:
- **G1**: `pmdarima>=2.0.0` + `scipy>=1.13.0` added to `pyproject.toml`
- **G2**: `telemetry/models.py` — `TelemetryRecord`, `ArimaForecast`, `ASIReport`
- **G3**: 4 new settings (`telemetry_enabled`, `asi_window_size`, `arima_confidence_level`, `asi_alert_threshold=60.0`)
- **G4**: `TelemetryCollector` upgraded to active probe with 5 canary prompts + `inject_canary_batch()`
- **G5**: `engine.py._run_telemetry_pass()` — post-campaign hook that runs ASI and attaches report to `CampaignResult.metadata`

**New Files**:
- `src/redthread/telemetry/models.py` — `TelemetryRecord`, `ArimaForecast`, `ASIReport` Pydantic models
- `src/redthread/telemetry/collector.py` — Active probe with canary injection and JSONL export
- `src/redthread/telemetry/arima.py` — `ArimaDetector` (pmdarima auto_arima + Z-score fallback)
- `src/redthread/telemetry/asi.py` — `AgentStabilityIndex` (30/30/25/15 weights, 0-100 score)
- `tests/test_arima.py` — 8 ARIMA-specific tests
- `tests/test_asi.py` — 11 ASI composite score tests

**Key Decisions**:
- **ARIMA**: `pmdarima.auto_arima` (dynamic order selection) — prevents silent false negatives from hardcoded (p,d,q)
- **Canary Prompts**: 5 deterministic benign probes (date, summary, math, repeat, geography) — noise-free RC control group
- **ASI Weights**: Response Consistency (0.30) + Semantic Drift (0.30) dominate — semantic > operational
- **Alert Threshold**: 60.0 — tripwire for Phase 5C campaign trigger, avoids alert fatigue
- **Integration**: Post-campaign only (not mid-campaign) — preserves attack velocity in supervisor
- **Storage**: In-memory + JSONL export for Phase 5B; SQLite deferred to Phase 5C daemon

**Verification**:
- 40/40 tests pass (22 new + 18 existing)
- ASI weights sum = 1.0
- All import chain validated


### Phase 5C: Continuous Monitoring ✅
**Objective**: Autonomous background health monitoring with drift-triggered campaign execution.

**Status**: Completed 2026-04-04

**Deliverables**:
- `src/redthread/telemetry/storage.py` — SQLite-backed TelemetryStorage (persistent across probe cycles)
- `src/redthread/telemetry/__init__.py` — Package init
- `src/redthread/daemon/__init__.py` — Daemon package init
- `src/redthread/daemon/monitor.py` — SecurityGuardDaemon with asyncio loop + circuit breaker
- `src/redthread/config/settings.py` — `monitor_probe_interval`, `monitor_auto_campaign`, `monitor_cooldown_period`
- `src/redthread/engine.py` — Wired TelemetryStorage into telemetry pass

**Key Decisions**:
- **SQLite storage**: TelemetryCollector delegates to TelemetryStorage for cross-cycle persistence (G3 fix)
- **Drift baseline warmup**: Daemon runs a warmup phase to bootstrap `fit_baseline()` (G2 fix)  
- **Circuit breaker**: `monitor_cooldown_period=1800s` — prevents runaway auto-campaigns (G6 fix)
- **Persistent collector**: Daemon holds a single collector instance across probe cycles (G5 fix)

---

### Phase 5D: CI/CD Integration ✅
**Objective**: Close the development lifecycle. Every PR passes automated quality gates before merge.

**Status**: Completed 2026-04-04

**Deliverables**:
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — Automated pipeline: quality-gate → unit-tests → golden-regression
- `.github/workflows/nightly-regression.yml` — Nightly full gpt-4o regression with GitHub issue on failure
- `src/redthread/observability/__init__.py` — Observability package
- `src/redthread/observability/tracing.py` — Conditional LangSmith `@traced` decorator + `init_langsmith()`
- `src/redthread/dashboard.py` — `load_campaign_history()` + `render_dashboard()` (Rich table)
- `Makefile` — `lint`, `typecheck`, `test`, `test-golden`, `ci`, `dev`, `install` targets

**Key Decisions**:
| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Golden Dataset trigger | Every PR + nightly | gpt-4o-mini for PR (cost), gpt-4o for nightly (accuracy) |
| LangSmith scope | Targeted | Mute Attacker (noise). Trace JudgeAgent + DefenseSynthesis only |
| Dashboard data | Campaign JSONL only | SQLite daemon data → Grafana/Metabase (future) |
| Ruff suppressions | Option B | Suppress pre-existing bulk violations, enforce on new code |

**Gap-Check Fixes Applied**:
- **G1** (broken ASI tests): `test_asi.py` updated to use `storage.insert()` instead of `_records.append()`
- **G2** (Ruff 111 errors): 32 auto-fixed via `ruff --fix`, remaining 6 suppressed with targeted ignores
- **G3** (Mypy 22 errors): Per-module `ignore_errors = true` for pre-existing violations, new code clean
- **G4** (langsmith installed): Confirmed — no new dependency needed
- **G5** (.gitignore minimal): Updated with 15+ missing patterns (`__pycache__/`, `.venv/`, `*.db`, etc.)

**CI/CD Pipeline**:
```
push/PR → quality-gate (ruff + mypy) → unit-tests → golden-regression
nightly → golden-regression (gpt-4o) → GitHub issue on failure
```

### Phase 6A: Crescendo Algorithm ✅
**Objective**: Implement multi-turn conversational escalation as the third core attack algorithm.

**Status**: Completed 2026-04-04

**Background**: Crescendo exploits the *context-window accumulation effect* — safety training is progressively overridden by conversational coherence pressure as turns accumulate. Unlike PAIR/TAP (single-turn refinement or tree search), Crescendo builds a shared conversation history and advances through 6 escalation levels (0–5).

**Deliverables**:
- `src/redthread/core/crescendo.py` — Escalation loop with client-side history and backtracking
- `tests/test_crescendo.py` — 8 tests covering all algorithm branches (mocked)
- `src/redthread/models.py` — Crescendo trace support alongside existing TAP and MCTS structures
- `src/redthread/config/settings.py` — Crescendo runtime settings added without removing broader attack-surface support
- `src/redthread/orchestration/graphs/attack_graph.py` — Crescendo dispatch path added to the attack worker graph
- `src/redthread/cli.py` — Crescendo controls added to the campaign CLI
- `src/redthread/evaluation/judge.py` — Crescendo trace formatting added to JudgeAgent evaluation

**Key Decisions**:
| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Phase split | 6A only | Crescendo proves the multi-turn pipeline as a first-class attack family |
| Conversation persistence | Client-side `list[tuple[str,str]]` | Surgical backtracking; PyRIT remains stateless |
| MCTS relationship | Coexists with Crescendo in the live tree | GS-MCTS remains part of the broader offense surface while Crescendo validates the escalation path |
| Cost estimation | Tracked separately from Crescendo | GS-MCTS is compute-heavy; Crescendo is bounded by `max_turns × backtrack_limit` |

**Architecture**:
```
INITIALIZATION
  → benign opener (escalation_level=0)
  → history = []

ESCALATION LOOP (1..max_turns)
  → attacker generates next prompt (system + history + level)
  → target receives full compiled conversation (stateless adapter)
  → judge.evaluate_turn_raw() → per-turn heuristic score

  IF score >= escalation_threshold → accept, advance level
  IF score < threshold → backtrack (up to backtrack_limit times)
  IF limit exceeded → accept partial, advance anyway
  IF score >= success_threshold → early termination

TERMINAL EVALUATION
  → judge.evaluate(trace) → full G-Eval → JudgeVerdict
```

**Verification**:
- 8/8 Crescendo tests pass
- Full regression suite passes with Crescendo added alongside the broader attack surface

### Phase 7A: Safe Patch Autoresearch (Offense) ✅
**Objective**: Promote RedThread from bounded prompt/runtime mutation into bounded source-patch autoresearch with explicit operator control.

**Status**: Completed 2026-04-07

**Deliverables**:
- `src/redthread/research/phase5.py` — formal Phase 5 wrapper for bounded source mutation cycles
- `research phase5 cycle|inspect|revert` — official CLI entrypoints
- enriched Phase 3 proposals with mutation provenance and promotion readiness metadata
- explicit research-plane acceptance gate before promotion
- `docs/AUTORESEARCH_PHASE5.md` — source-patch autoresearch contract

**Key Decisions**:
| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Mutation style | Template-driven only | Keeps code mutation deterministic and reversible |
| Safety boundary | Phase 3 accept/reject remains mandatory | Promotion must not bypass operator approval |
| Protected surfaces | evaluation, defense, telemetry, golden dataset, promotion logic | Prevents autoresearch from mutating its own safety gates |
| CLI strategy | `phase5` is official, `mutate` remains compatible | Preserves existing workflows while clarifying roadmap direction |

### Phase 7B: Bounded Defense Prompt Autoresearch ✅
**Objective**: Add a conservative defense-side autoresearch lane without opening runtime defense logic or production safety gates to mutation.

**Status**: Completed 2026-04-08

**Deliverables**:
- `src/redthread/research/phase6.py` — formal Phase 6 wrapper for bounded defense prompt mutation cycles
- `research phase6 cycle|inspect|revert` — official CLI entrypoints
- `src/redthread/research/defense_source_mutation_registry.py` — defense prompt mutation templates
- `src/redthread/research/defense_source_mutation_policy.py` — defense-only mutation surface policy
- `src/redthread/research/defense_source_mutation_validator.py` — sealed pre-apply validation gate
- additive mutation-phase provenance in Phase 3 proposals and source-mutation manifests
- `docs/AUTORESEARCH_PHASE6.md` — defense prompt autoresearch contract

**Key Decisions**:
| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Mutable surface | defense prompt/template assets only | Keeps runtime defense logic and benign pack sealed |
| Validation gate | deterministic pre-apply checks | Rejected candidates must fail closed before entering Phase 3 |
| Proposal flow | reuse existing Phase 3 / promotion flow | Avoids creating a second promotion plane |
| Scope control | prompt-contract only in v1 | Conservative first step before richer replay fixtures |
